Developing Data Products Project - Fitbit Step Prediction  
==========================================================

This Shiny App is used display Fitbit data and predict the number of steps
based on variable input for a certain value. It should be noticed that this is
just an example and the prediction should not be taken to seriously.

This project was created by Gert De Geyter as a project for the John Hopkings
Coursera Course "Developing Data Product".
